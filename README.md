## Design Approach

**Tenets**

1. **Make them easy to understand**; wherever possible the structure of types
   and choice of names should be consistent across packages.
1. **Make them composable**; packages should only model a single standard and
   should reuse others.
1. **Keep them up-to-date**; find ways to automate updates from source material.

So far there are three distinct patterns used when implementing codes, namely:

* **Named Enumeration Type**; these are cases where the standard defines a
  clearly enumerated set of values commonly referred to by some non-numeric
  identifier or name. The code type is a Rust **`enum`** with each identifier
  or name as a variant. The [codes-iso-4217](https://docs.rs/codes-iso-4217)
  package is an example of this pattern.
* **Constant Numeric Type**; these are cases where the standard defines a
  clearly enumerated set of numeric values that identify specific codes. In
  this case we use a
  [newtype](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html)
  to capture the specific numeric identifiers and a set of defined constant
  instances. The [codes-iana-charset](https://docs.rs/codes-iana-charset)
  package is an example of this pattern.
* **Non-Enumerated Type**; these are cases there the standard does not define
  values, but addresses the format, or structure, of a code or identifier. For
  example the Legal Entity ID specification describes the format of an
  identifier but cannot enumerate all possible values. The
  [codes-iso-17442](https://docs.rs/codes-iso-17442) package is an example of
  this pattern.

### Common Features

All codes, regardless of pattern implement the `codes-common::Code` trait
which simply acts as a set of required minimum capabilities.

``` rust
pub trait Code<T>: 
    Clone + Debug + Display + FromStr + Into<T> + PartialEq + Eq + Hash {}
```

Most types so far therefore have a definition including the following derived
implementations.

``` rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", derive(Deserialize, Serialize))]
/* ExampleCode */
```

Additionally, for non-copy types, it is common to implement `AsRef`.

Property, and therefore method, values should be as simple as possible and
given that most values are constructed at build time it is possible to use
static values. Where possible strings should be returned as `&'static str` and
numeric values as appropriate. 

In some cases it would be valuable to return a parsed, or extended, value type
instead of a simple string. For example the method `website_url` could return
the `url::Url` type, or `creation_date` could return `chrono::DateTime`.
However, these should not necessarily be required and so gating the extended
type version with a feature is a recommended practice.

```rust
impl ExampleCode {
    #[cfg(feature = "real_url")]
    pub fn website_url(&self) -> Option<url::Url> {
        todo!()
    }
    #[cfg(not(feature = "real_url"))]
    pub const fn website_url(&self) -> Option<&'static str> {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

Accessor methods should also be marked **`const`** as much as possible.

``` rust
impl ExampleCode {
     pub const fn code(&self) -> &'static str {
         match self {
             Self::ExampleOne => "001",
             Self::ExampleTwo => "002",
             // ...
         }
     }
}
```

Finally, the `codes-common` package defines an error that has specific
variants useful for `FromStr` implementations and may be re-exported by
specific standard packages.

``` rust
pub use codes_common::CodeParseError as ExampleCodeError;
```

### Named Enumeration Pattern

The data type for this pattern looks like any standard Rust enum, and should
provide some meaningful doc comment. In many cases the common names for
variants do not conform to Rust naming conventions such as the two-letter
country code "US" or the three-letter currency code "USD", this is preferred
over forcing commonly used uppercase identifiers into Camel case.

``` rust
pub enum ExampleCode {
    /// Example number one
    ExampleOne,
    /// Example number two
    ExampleTwo,
    /// Example number three
    ExampleThree,
    /// Example number four
    ExampleFour,
}
```

The implementation of `FromStr` will use the values `ExampleOne`, `ExampleTwo`, etc.

An array is provided for each code type that contains all values, this is
particularly useful for creation of indexes and filter functions by iterating
over this value.

``` rust
pub const ALL_CODES: [ExampleCode;4] = [
    ExampleCode::ExampleOne,
    ExampleCode::ExampleTwo[,
    ExampleCode::ExampleThree,
    ExampleCode::ExampleFour,
];
```

### Constant Numeric Pattern

The data type for this pattern is a simple newtype struct wrapping an
appropriate numerical type. The default type for integer values is `u16`.

``` rust
pub struct ExampleCode(u16);
```

For numeric code types there should also be an implementation of `TryFrom` to
convert from numeric values into the code type.

``` rust
impl TryFrom<u16> for ExampleCode {
    // ...
```

For ease of use, each defined value is represented as a constant value. The
naming of these constants should have a meaningful prefix which may be the
standard name or some derived form.

``` rust
pub const EXAMPLE_1: ExampleCode = ExampleCode(1);
```

Finally, an equivalent `ALL_CODES` array is provided.

``` rust
pub const ALL_CODES: [ExampleCode;4] = [
    EXAMPLE_1,
    EXAMPLE_2,
    EXAMPLE_3,
    EXAMPLE_4,
];
```

### Non-Enumerated Type Pattern

Whenever possible the use of `FromStr` or `TryFrom` should be used over
explicit constructor functions. If an explicit function is required it should
be `new`, `new_with...`, or `new_from`.

``` rust
impl ExampleCode {
    pub const fn is_valid(s: &'static str) -> bool {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

At times it is useful to have a constructor that *does not* perform validity
checks. This is particularly useful within a package for constructing constant
values and so forth. In this case the name `new_unchecked` is used to allow
for the function to stand out when used.

``` rust
impl ExampleCode {
    #[doc(hidden)]
    pub(crate) const fn new_unchecked(s: &'static str) -> Self {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

It is not required that this function is private, but care should be taken in
making *unchecked* operations public.
