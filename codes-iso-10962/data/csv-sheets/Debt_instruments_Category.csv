S,Structured instruments (capital protection),"Capital protected structured instruments offer investors exposure to chosen underlying assets using various approaches and offering a large variety of asymmetric pay-off profiles. There are one or more reference entities underlying the product. Redemption is made at least in the amount of the conditional capital protection at maturity, provided that no credit event by the reference entity has occurred. Conditional capital protection only applies to the nominal amount and not to the purchase price. The general functioning of a capital guaranteed structured instrument is as follows: the notional amount is split into a zero bond, that will deliver the capital guarantee at maturity, and the difference between the zero bond’s value (= present value of the guarantee level at maturity) and the notional amount is used for structuring the performance component with options which deliver the agreed pay-off profile of the structured instrument.",D-S-*-*-*-*,DSXXXX,2019
E,Structured instruments (without capital protection),"A structured instrument without capital protection is a short-term note linked to an underlying stock. The security offers a steady stream of income due to the payment of a coupon rate. The redemption at the end of the term is determined on the basis of the performance and final fixing of the underlying asset: a redemption at the nominal value is guaranteed as long as the underlying asset has not touched its barrier during relevant barrier monitoring. If the underlying asset has touched its barrier but is again above the strike price at final fixing, the nominal price is also repaid. Nevertheless, if the underlying asset has touched its barrier during barrier monitoring and closes below the strike price at final fixing, the underlying asset is delivered or cash compensation paid, provided that no credit event by the reference entity has occurred. Depending on the characteristics of the product, either a coupon or a discount to the underlying asset can apply. A coupon is paid out regardless of the performance of the underlying asset, provided that no credit event by the reference entity has occurred.",D-E-*-*-*-*,DEXXXX,2019
G,Mortgage-backed securities,"Mortgage-backed securities are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans, most commonly on residential property. Mortgage loans are purchased from banks, mortgage companies and other originators, and then assembled into pools by a governmental, quasi-governmental or private entity. The entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool, a process known as securitization.",D-G-*-*-*-*,DGXXXX,2019
