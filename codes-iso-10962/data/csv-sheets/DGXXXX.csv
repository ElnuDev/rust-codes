Mortgage-backed securities,(D-G),"Mortgage-backed securities are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans, most commonly on residential property. Mortgage loans are purchased from banks, mortgage companies and other originators, and then assembled into pools by a governmental, quasi-governmental or private entity. The entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool, a process known as securitization.",D-G-*-*-*-*,DGXXXX,,,
