Rates,(S-R),"A rates swap is a contract in which two counterparties each agree to pay the other cash flows on defined dates during an agreed period, based on a specified notional amount and a floating interest, floating inflation or fixed interest rate.",S-R-*-*-*-*,SRXXXX
First attribute,,Underlying assets,Code,rdfs.label
,A,"Basis swap (float-float) [a rate swap where the cash flows that are exchanged between each party are based on different floating interest rates or prices (i.e. one party pays an agreed floating rate multiplied by a notional amount, in exchange for receipt of periodic payments based on another agreed floating rate multiplied by the same notional amount, from the other party)], except those swaps covered by the definitions below for attributes G or H",S-R-A-*-*-*,SRAXXX
,C,"Fixed-floating [a rate swap in which one party (the fixed rate payer) agrees to make fixed payments (the fixed leg) on set dates for an agreed period to another party (the floating rate payer), based on a fixed interest rate multiplied by a notional amount, in exchange for receipt of periodic payments (the floating leg), from the floating rate payer, based on a floating interest rate index multiplied by the same notional amount (in most cases) upon which the fixed rate payments are based], except those swaps covered by the definitions below for attributes G, H or Z",S-R-C-*-*-*,SRCXXX
,D,"Fixed-fixed (a rate swap in which both parties pay a fixed interest rate that they could not otherwise obtain outside of a swap arrangement; for example, if each counterparty uses a different native currency, but wants to borrow money in the other counterparty’s native currency; fixed-fixed swaps generally take the form of either a zero coupon swap or a cross-currency swap), except those swaps covered by the definitions below for attributes G or Z",S-R-D-*-*-*,SRDXXX

,H,Overnight index swap (OIS) [a rate swap in which one party (the fixed rate payer) makes periodic payments to another party (the floating rate payer) based on a fixed interest rate (other than zero) or floating interest rate multiplied by a notional amount in exchange for receipt of periodic payments based on an overnight interest rate index multiplied by the same notional amount upon which the fixed rate payments are based],S-R-H-*-*-*,SRHXXX
,Z,"Zero coupon [a rate swap in which the fixed rate cash flows are compounded and paid once on the expiration data, rather than periodically; the payments on the other side (which can be based on a floating interest rate or a fixed rate) follow typical swap payment schedules]",S-R-Z-*-*-*,SRZXXX
